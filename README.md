# MyFirstchatbot1
This project is an interactive chatbot built using LangChain, Ollama LLM, and Streamlit. It leverages the power of local LLMs (like LLaMA 2) for generating natural language responses to user queries. The chatbot interface is built with Streamlit, enabling real-time user interaction via a simple web app.
